# Advent-of-Code-2022

This is my code repository for my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenge.

I use [Haskell Tool Stack](https://haskellstack.org) to build, test and run this project.

## Build

```shell
stack build
```

## Run tests

```shell
stack test
```

## Run main

### Run default puzzles (except some long-running ones)

```shell
stack run
```

### Run specific puzzle

```shell
stack run day06
```

### Run all puzzles (may take a few minutes)

```shell
stack run all
```
